## Reverse Engineering the Binary

### Step 1: Download and Unzip the Binary
1. **Download the zip file** from [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one) containing the binary.
2. **Unzip the file** to extract the binary for reverse engineering.

### Step 2: Running the Binary
1. **Execute the binary** to observe its behavior.
2. The binary prompts for a password and checks its correctness. If the password is incorrect, it returns "Bad boy!".

### Step 3: Decompiling the Binary
1. **Use your decompiler of choice** (e.g., Ghidra) to analyze the binary.
2. Here, we use **Ghidra** to decompile the binary and extract the function of interest.

### Decompiled Code Analysis

```c
undefined8 FUN_001010c0(void)
{
    long in_FS_OFFSET;
    int local_118;
    short local_114;
    long local_10;
    
    local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
    __printf_chk(1, "Enter the password: ");
    __isoc99_scanf("%255s", &local_118);
    if ((local_118 == 0x30783468) && (local_114 == 0x72)) {
        puts("Good boy!");
    } else {
        puts("Bad boy!");
    }
    if (local_10 == *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
        return 0;
    }
    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
}
```

### Function Breakdown

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - The function sets up several local variables and a stack canary to protect against buffer overflow attacks.

2. **Stack Canary Setup**:
   ```c
   local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
   ```
   - This stores a value from the stack, typically a canary value used for detecting stack smashing.

3. **Password Prompt**:
   ```c
   __printf_chk(1, "Enter the password: ");
   ```
   - Prompts the user to enter a password.

4. **Password Input**:
   ```c
   __isoc99_scanf("%255s", &local_118);
   ```
   - Reads the user input (up to 255 characters) and stores it in `local_118`.

5. **Password Verification**:
   ```c
   if ((local_118 == 0x30783468) && (local_114 == 0x72)) {
       puts("Good boy!");
   } else {
       puts("Bad boy!");
   }
   ```
   - Checks if `local_118` equals `0x30783468` (813184104 in decimal) and `local_114` equals `0x72` (114 in decimal).
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "Good boy!". Otherwise, it prints "Bad boy!".

6. **Stack Canary Verification**:
   ```c
   if (local_10 == *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
       return 0;
   }
   __stack_chk_fail();
   ```
   - Verifies that the stack canary value is unchanged.
   - If the canary is altered, it calls `__stack_chk_fail()`, which typically aborts the program to prevent further damage from a potential overflow attack.

### Conclusion
To pass the password check and get the "Good boy!" message:
- The password entered must be `813184104`.
- The `local_114` value must be `114`.

### Practical Steps
1. **Run the program** and wait for the prompt "Enter the password:".
2. **Input the correct password**: `813184104`.

### Example Interaction
```
Enter the password: 813184104
Good boy!
```

# CTF Write-Ups Repository

Welcome to my Capture the Flag (CTF) Write-Ups repository. This repository contains detailed write-ups of various CTF challenges I have solved. Each write-up includes a description of the challenge, my thought process, the steps I took to solve it, and any relevant scripts or tools I used.


## Introduction

Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are a great way to practice and enhance your cybersecurity skills. This repository serves as a collection of my experiences and solutions to various CTF challenges. I hope these write-ups will be helpful to others in the cybersecurity community.

## Usage

To navigate through the repository, simply browse through the directories and files. Each challenge write-up is stored in its own directory, named after the challenge. Inside each directory, you will find:

- A `README.md` file containing the write-up for the challenge.
- Any scripts or tools I used to solve the challenge.
- Screenshots or other media related to the challenge (if applicable).
